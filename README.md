## Disclaimer

This project doesn't aim to be feature complete. Although it would like to be generic, it also currently specific DB2 constructs.

## Notes

A DDL basically consists of two types of "statements": comments and actual
statements. The former is identified by a double leading dash (--), the
latter are separated using semi-colons (;).

The DDL parser starts of by checking if its current input starts with a double
dash, if so, the remainder of the line, up to a new-line character (optional
carriage returns are discarded anyway), is wrapped in a Comment object. If it
is a statement, everything up to the next semi-colon is further parsed as a Statement.
